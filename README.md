## Outcomes

This project will be able to:

	1. Recognize the potential of AI in solving societal problems and leverage it to create a solution that can help prevent incidents of violence and lower crime rates.

	2. Demonstrate an understanding of the practical applications of the technology, highlighting its usefulness in smaller spaces, such as offices, where stress levels can be monitored and addressed in real-time.

	3. Emphasise the importance of identifying distress before it escalates into harmful behaviour, allowing individuals and organisations to take proactive measures.
